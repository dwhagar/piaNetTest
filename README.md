# piaNetTest
Automatically test the network status of a Mac and either connect or disconnect PIA automatically.

This requires the latest version of the Private Internet Access VPN client and is meant as mostly an example / proof of concept.  It does work on my system but that is no gaurentee it will work on your system.

Read through variables for both files to customize to your own liking.

I made this for myself and not for anyone else.  The only reason I'm posting it here is so that others may have an easier time solving this particular problem.

As a side-note, I know that Mac's use ZSH currently and perhaps I should use that as the interpreter.  My default is BASH through so I used that.  It might work fine in ZSH but I haven't tried.
